	abstract={Systems with short-range attractive and long-range repulsive interactions are able to form mesophases at sufficiently low temperatures. In two dimensions, such mesophases emerge as clusters, stripes or bubbles. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations we investigate the static and the dynamic properties of such a cluster-forming system over a broad temperature range and for different densities. Via the static properties we analyse how ordering into close packed configurations sets in both at the level of the particles as well as at the level of the clusters. The dynamic properties provide information on how, at low temperature, the motion of individual particles is influenced by the dynamic slowing down of the clusters. Finally, we discuss the different diffusion mechanisms at play at low and intermediate densities.}

	abstract = {Suspensions of spherical colloidal particles in a liquid show a fascinating variety of phase behaviour which can mimic that of simple atomic liquids and solids. â€ Colloidal fluids'1â€“4, in which there are significant short-range correlations between the positions of neighbouring particles, and â€ colloidal crystals'5â€“7, which have long-range spatial order, have been investigated extensively. We report here a detailed study of the phase diagram of suspensions of colloidal spheres which interact through a steep repulsive potential. With increasing particle concentration we observed a progression from colloidal fluid, to fluid and crystal phases in coexistence, to fully crystallized samples. At the highest concentrations we obtained very viscous samples in which full crystallization had not occurred after several months and in which the particles appeared to be arranged as an amorphous â€ colloidal glass'. The empirical phase diagram can be reproduced reasonably well by an effective hard-sphere model. The observation of the colloidal glass phase is interesting both in itself and because of possible relevance to the manufacture of high-strength ceramics8.},
